# Daily-Activity-Analysis
Fitness Tracker Data Analysis
This Python project is aimed at analyzing daily fitness data using popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Plotly. The project's primary objective is to gain insights into a user's fitness habits and provide meaningful feedback based on their daily activity.

The dataset used in this project consists of daily fitness data captured by a fitness tracker. The data includes metrics such as steps taken, calories burned, distance traveled, active minutes, and sleep time. The fitness tracker data has been collected over a period of 30 days.

Project Goals
The goals of this project are to:

Explore the fitness tracker dataset and gain insights into a user's daily activity
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accurate analysis
Analyze trends in the fitness data and identify patterns in a user's activity
Visualize the data using various plots and charts to better understand the data
Provide meaningful feedback based on a user's daily activity
Technologies Used
This project uses the following Python libraries:

Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: for numerical operations and calculations
Matplotlib: for data visualization
Plotly: for interactive data visualization
Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

Data Cleaning: This section includes data cleaning and preprocessing steps such as removing missing values, handling outliers, and converting data types.
Data Analysis: This section includes analyzing trends in the fitness data, identifying patterns in a user's activity, and providing feedback based on their daily activity.
Data Visualization: This section includes creating various plots and charts to better understand the data and visualize the trends and patterns identified in the data.
Conclusion
This project provides an opportunity to gain insights into a user's fitness habits using data analysis and visualization. By using popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Plotly, we can effectively analyze and visualize the data, providing meaningful feedback to the user based on their daily activity.
